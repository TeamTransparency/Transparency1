# Transparency

Your one stop shop to view donor and bill information for state senators

[Transparency](https://teamtransparency.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation

Our motivation for this project is to simplify the process of finding donor and bill information for each state senator all within one app. From there, we wanted to see if there was a relationship between the bills senators introduced and their top contributors and industries.  

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- React
- Material UI
- Node JS
- Express
- Axios for AJAX requests
- OpenSecrets API
- ProPublica Congress API
- MongoDB

## Features

Polished UI and simple to use for an easy and effective user experience. Our one page application has a dropdown for simple state searches. This search functionality calls the OpenSecrets API and ProPublica Congress API.

Senators display in an easy to read way complete with contact information, top contributions and industries in their most recent election, and top bills introduced, all with links for more information.

## API Reference

- [OpenSecrets API](https://www.opensecrets.org/open-data/api)
- [ProPublica Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api)

## How to use?

Open our link, and you will find our one page application. Simply search by state from the dropdown menu. The two state senators will display as a card with their contact and website information. You can view the top 10 contributors and amounts as well as the top 10 industries and amounts by simply clicking on the expand button. In addition to the expand button, you can find the top 20 bills introduced by that specific senator with a link for more information regarding a certain bill. At anytime, you may switch the state from the dropdown menu to view senator information you are seeking.
